[Download Clockwork.](https://github.com/CloudSixteen/Clockwork/archive/master.zip)\r\n2. [Install Clockwork.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/installation)\r\n3. [Configure Clockwork.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/configuration)\r\n\r\nAfter all of that is done, great, it's time to move on to the schema itself.\r\n\r\n1. [Download the schema.](https://github.com/sannysc/cwstarwars/zipball/master)\r\n2. Extract the schema from the zip file and rename it to **cwstarwars**\r\n3. [Get your serial key.](http://authx.cloudsixteen.com/starwars.php)\r\n4. [Install the schema.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/installation) (scroll down to the Schema Installation step)\r\n5.

Edit the intro in **schema/cl_intro.lua** and change all the factions' whitelist values to your liking in the **schema/factions** folder.\r\n\r\nHaving trouble? Post on the [schema's thread.](http://forums.cloudsixteen.com/threads/star-wars-schema.25546/) Do **NOT** open a support ticket on Cloud Sixteen.\r\n\r\nPlease remember this is the first preliminary version of the gamemode.
