# CW: Star Wars
A roleplaying universe taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

# How do I use this?

The first thing you'll need to do is get Clockwork set up on your server.

1. [Download Clockwork.](https://github.com/CloudSixteen/Clockwork/archive/master.zip)
2. [Install Clockwork.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/installation)
3. [Configure Clockwork.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/configuration)

After all of that is done, great, it's time to move on to the schema itself.

1. [Download the schema.](https://github.com/sannysc/cwstarwars/zipball/master)
2. Extract the schema from the zip file and rename it to **cwstarwars**
3. [Get your serial key.](http://authx.cloudsixteen.com/starwars.php)
4. [Install the schema.](http://wiki.cloudsixteen.com/installation) (scroll down to the Schema Installation step)
5. [Host workshop collection](http://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_for_Dedicated_Servers) **693723945**
6. Lift off: you're done. Edit the intro in **schema/cl_intro.lua** and change all the factions' whitelist values to your liking in the **schema/factions** folder.

Having trouble? Post on the [schema's thread.](http://forums.cloudsixteen.com/threads/star-wars-schema.25546/) Do **NOT** open a support ticket on Cloud Sixteen.

Please remember this is the first preliminary version of the gamemode. It isn't finished yet.
